University Webpage Project
This is a simple static webpage created using HTML and CSS.

📝 Overview
This project simulates a basic university homepage, featuring a navigation bar, an image of the campus, and a simple application form.

🛠️ Key Components
HTML: Defines the structure (header, navigation, form, footer).

CSS: Styles the layout, colors, and interactive elements (like the navigation links and the submit button). The CSS is currently embedded directly in the HTML file.

🔮 Future Improvements
