# University Webpage Project
This is a simple static webpage created using HTML and CSS.

 ## Overview
This project simulates a basic university homepage, featuring a navigation bar, an image of the campus, and a simple application form.

## Key Components
HTML: Defines the structure (header, navigation, form, footer).

CSS: Styles the layout, colors, and interactive elements (like the navigation links and the submit button). The CSS is currently embedded directly in the HTML file.

## How to Run
Clone this repository.

Open the index.html file in your web browser.

## Future Improvements
Move the styles to a separate style.css file.

Improve mobile responsiveness.
